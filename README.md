# Tradeshift Triangle Challenge

### This application is implemented using: 
* ReactJS via create-react-app
* react-tradeshift-ui

I used React to implement this challenge because I am comfortable creating web applications using this framework. Also, with React I could easily use the Tradeshift UI components available here: http://ui.tradeshift.com/v12/#intro/

### Design Decisions
To complete the challenge, I implemented Factory Design Pattern to create Triangle objects. The factory takes in three inputs, one for each side of the triangle. The factory returns either an Equilateral, Isosceles, or Scalene triangle based on the values of those inputs. 

## To Start: 

* ### git clone https://github.com/andrewmunoz001/tradeshiftChallenge.git

* ### `npm start`
